## 4. Data Challenges
The dataset has several real-world challenges:

- **Missing values:** Some rows may lack price or availability information.  
- **Duplicates:** Same products may appear multiple times with different prices.  
- **Typos / Inconsistent text:** Market names may be misspelled.  
- **Imbalance:** Availability is mostly *High*, while *Low* is rare.  
- **Special rule:** Sugar price is fixed at $15 per standard unit, unlike other products.

## 5. Machine Learning Use Cases

- **Regression:**  
  - Predict product prices based on origin, market, and availability.  
  - Example: Predicting next weekâ€™s Rice price.

- **Classification:**  
  - Predict Availability (High/Medium/Low) based on price and origin.  
  - Example: Determining if a product will be available or scarce in the market.

- **Clustering:**  
  - Group similar products or markets based on prices.  
  - Example: Comparing *Injida Market* with other markets to observe pricing patterns.

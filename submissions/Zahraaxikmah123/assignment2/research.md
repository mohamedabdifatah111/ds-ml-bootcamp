# üìù Research Paper: Food & Coffee Preferences Dataset

## Title & Collection Method

**Title:** Food & Coffee Preferences and Their Impact on Productivity  
**Collection Method:** I designed a Google Form survey and shared it with university students and other friends. The survey collected **71 responses** within two days. Questions covered eating habits, coffee consumption, spending patterns, and productivity levels. The dataset is **self-collected**, not from any pre-made repository.

## Quality Issues

* **Missing values:** Some rows have missing data (e.g., Age, Cups of Coffee, Preferred Coffee Type).  
* **Categorical encoding needed:** Coffee Consumption, Preferred Coffee Type, Sugar Usage, and Favorite Meal must be encoded before modeling.  
* **Outliers:** Daily Spending can contain extreme values (e.g., `1000`) which must be handled.
* **Imbalance:** Productivity values are skewed (more low ratings than high ratings).  
* **Inconsistent entries:** Cups of Coffee sometimes uses values like `"4+"` instead of numeric.

## Use Case

This dataset can be applied to a **regression task** predicting productivity levels based on coffee and spending habits.  

* Possible models: **Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting**  

It can also be applied to **classification**, e.g., predicting **High vs. Low productivity**.  

* Possible models: **Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier**  

It can also be used for **clustering**, e.g., segmenting people into groups:  

* Coffee-heavy consumers with high productivity  
* Non-coffee consumers with low productivity  
* Balanced consumers with medium productivity

## Conclusion

This dataset of 71 samples highlights the relationship between **coffee consumption, spending habits, and productivity levels**. Despite quality issues (missing values, outliers, imbalance, inconsistent entries), it provides a solid foundation for building Machine Learning models.  

The main goal is to understand how **coffee and food preferences** affect daily productivity. These insights could lead to practical applications such as **personalized marketing for caf√©s**, improved academic productivity strategies, and **awareness of lifestyle impacts on performance**.

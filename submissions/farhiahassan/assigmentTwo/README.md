The Transport Habits Dataset contains information about daily trips, including distance, transport mode, waiting time, trip duration, cost, and whether travelers arrive on time. Collected via a Google Form survey, it includes 50 samples with 5 features and 1 label. The dataset can be used for machine learning tasks such as predicting punctuality, estimating trip duration or cost, and identifying travel patterns through clustering. While it contains some missing values, outliers, and imbalanced transport modes, it provides useful insights for analyzing travel behavior and supporting data-driven planning and decision-making.

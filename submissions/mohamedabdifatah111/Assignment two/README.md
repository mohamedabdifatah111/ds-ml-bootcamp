The Mkulima Market Prices Dataset was collected manually at Nairobi’s Mkulima Market over one trading day (8 AM–5 PM). It contains 50 rows and 6 columns, capturing features such as commodity, price per kilogram, quantity, time of observation, and vendor type, with sales estimate as the label. The dataset can be used for regression (predicting sales), classification (categorizing vendors as high, medium, or low sellers), and clustering (grouping vendor behaviors). It includes common real-world issues like missing values, typos, duplicates, imbalances, and mixed data formats.
